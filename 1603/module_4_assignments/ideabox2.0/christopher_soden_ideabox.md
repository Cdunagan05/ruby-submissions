## Completion

Missing 100 character truncation

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[GitHub](https://github.com/seeker105/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L124-L129)
This required exploring new JavaScript functionality that I was completely unfamiliar with. I used the debugger to check return values and function results. I had to experiment with triggering `focusout` and `blur` to see which produced the result I needed.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[GitHub](https://github.com/seeker105/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L62-L87)
Waaay too much repetition.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
