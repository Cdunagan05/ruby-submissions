### Code Quality:
##### Link to a specific block of code on Github that you are proud of
 [Building Ideas on document.ready](https://github.com/ExCaelum/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/build_ideas.js)

##### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I am proud of this code because this is the first piece of JS that I have written that I understand. I feel like it definitely could be better, but I am proud of the way it turned out and the way it functions for it being my first piece of JavaScript code.

##### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Voting](https://github.com/ExCaelum/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/voting.js)

##### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I was really struggling with keeping the logic in JS. I had issues making the JS communicate with the enum quality for ideas. I was forced to move the logic of updating into the idea model itself, and I would have liked to figure out how to do it in JavaScript.
