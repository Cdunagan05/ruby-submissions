# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* The search feature was a feature that I found particularly difficult since I was using a table and had to search by two table cell elements. While this function could use some refactoring, I felt proud to accomplish searching on this element type.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* I would have preferred to use a different technique to append new information.  Storing this data to a JavaScript object and iterating over these objects while building them to the DOM would have been a technique worth trying.  Therefore I wouldn't have to just rely on the DOM for the "true" information.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
